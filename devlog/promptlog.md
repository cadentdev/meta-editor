I want to create a web page that will write a Markdown file with frontmatter by reading the contents of specific fields.

What should I call the repository?

These are good names, but I'm going to go with `meta-editor` because Markdown is one of the possible output formats, but I could also use the same form to create an html file.

## 04:59

I'd like to create a web-based editor that prepares a post for publication on the web by adding essential meta data. 

- I'd like the code to execute in the browser, meaning I don't want to have to call the server. This suggests implementing the code in JavaScript, although I'm open to other suggestions
- I'd like to be able to save to local browser storage so we can reload work from session to session.  
- The output should be displayed in a "preview" area as Markdown-formatted text, with a "Copy" button nearby allowing a user to copy the output to the clipboard.

Here's some sample output. Notice the fields in the frontmatter YAML section (e.g. `Title` or `Date`). Also, the text at the bottom of the page, from `[Contact me]({filename}...` onward, is generic "footer" material that I'd like to reuse across multiple pages. Everything should be editable. 

Please ask me any questions you need answered before we start writing code.

## 05:01

Excellent questions! Here are my replies:

1. Separate input fields for each frontmatter element are essential.
2. I'd like to work on one document at a time.
3. If possible, I'd like to use vanilla JS.
4. I'd like to be able to upload one "hero" image, then add the "alt" descriptive text to that image. The Markdown code referring to the image, with the associated "alt" text, could then be inserted into the top of the document.
5. I'd like to add some basic validation. Some fields should be validated for length (Title and Summary, for example), and the Date field should be validated for proper formatting. Maybe that field could use a calendar / time widget to select the date and time as well. The Tags field should list each tag phrase as a graphical object, instead of raw text, with an "x" next to the tag text to remove a specific tag. Typing in the tag field will create a new "tag object"

## 05:15

Done! I'm going to test it!

## 05:44

Great work! Let's add a "Header Text" field, below the "Image Alt Text" field and above the "Content" field, simlar to the "Footer Text" field (formely called "Footer")

## 05:44

Yes, I'd like to be able to upload a Markdown file and parse it so the fields are populated based on the contents of the YAML frontmatter. You can ignore the Header and Footer fields for now, simply add everything that's not YAML frontmatter to the Content field.

Let's add a "File Name" field that's populated when we upload a file

Do you have any suggestions on how we could parse out the Header and Footer Text? I'm considering treating these as "special fields" that persist from session to session, but I'm not sure how to save the text without having to connect with the server. Obviously we can write the text into the code, but that makes editing difficult. Any ideas?

Yes, your suggestion is excellent. Let's implement it. The easiest option for parsing the header & footer text is to simply look for matching text in the uploaded data and remove it from the content. Let's try that to start  Before you begin, please check the syntax of the scripts.js file, since you ran into some syntax issues when you tried to implement this feature previously.

Now that we have a working upload feature, let's add a Download Markdown File feature. Ensure the Download button is only active if the "File Name" field has a valid filename. A valid filename is:

- all lowercase
- uses the "-" (hyphen) character to separate words
- does not require a file extension
- If the file extension is present, it must be ".md"

Also, this validation check should also run when the contents of the File Name field is updated.

I uploaded the file "words-of-wisdom.md" and the File Name field was correctly populated with "words-of-wisdom". Unfortunately, the "Download Markdown" button is inactive, until I append ".md" to the text in the File Name field. I'd like the "Download Markdown" to be active if _either_ the correct extension is present (".md") or no extension is present, as is the case when we upload a file.

It looks like the validation runs when I type in the File Name field, but doesn't run when the code fills in the file name after a Markdown file is uploaded successfully. Can you run the validation after a file upload is completed?

OK, looks good. Now we need to append the ".md" extension to the filename when the user clicks the Download Markdown button if it's not present in the File Name field

OK, thanks for checking. On the Mac, the Download File dialog supresses the display of the extension.

Yes, during the file upload, please extract the first image you encounter in the uploaded file as the "hero" image and populate the Image Alt Text field with the alt text contents. Also add a new "Image File Name" field that is populated through this upload process with the image name you discover in the hero image Markdown code, or when the user selects an image using the "Choose File" button. 


The Image markdown code is extracted correctly into the Image File Name and Alt Text fields, but it appears both in the "Content" field and the "Preview" field. Also, when I update the Alt text in the field, it doesn't seem to update the Preview text. Please remove the Hero image code from the "Content" field and ensure the image code is updated correctly in the Preview field if either the Image Name or Alt Text fields are updated.

Fantastic! Let's update the README file to reflect the updates to handling Image data during uploads and in the Preview field

Based on your excellent summary of what we've accomplished, and the current contents of the README file and our project code, do you think we need to make any addtional changes or updates to the README to capture the current state of the project and the codebase?

Excellent work! I'm going to test our output by feeding the Markdown to a Static Site Generator, Pelican, and check to ensure the generated HTML looks like we'd expect.
