Let's create a Settings feature as described in the ROADMAP.md file under the heading "Basic AI Generation".  This feature should open a modal dialog box with a form to edit the AI settings.  The settings should include the Ollama endpoint and preferred model. First, the user will specify the Ollama endpoint, then the app will retrieve the avaialable models and display them so the user can select the preferred model. The settings should be saved to localStorage and used by the AI generation features.

Let's run the webserver! I'd like to test it too

As you can see from this screenshot, the Settings dialog doesn't have a clearly labeled field to allow me to enter my endpoint. Let's update the dialog box to fix this.

I can't see any difference at all in the dialog

Can you use Playwright to view the Settings dialog on your own to confirm your  changes have taken effect properly?

Let's update the README.md, CLAUDE.md, and ROADMAP.md file to include the new Settings feature.
